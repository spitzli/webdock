# Webdock Mail integration evidence

Date: 2026-10-10. Status: **private CE provisioning foundation deployed and live-tested on Contabo; public delivery and the complete Mail product remain unfinished.**

Owner decision: [CE per customer with activated email](mail-deployment-decision.md). Reproduction: `npm run test:integration -w @webdock/mail` on the documented local Linux/Node 24 environment.

Initial verification: unit tests, real CE integration and TypeScript passed. Current agent verification is recorded below. An independent review identified Docker context precedence as a local-only guard bypass; two regression tests failed before the fix and now pass. Setup, child tests and cleanup all use the resolved, pinned local daemon.

## Verified

| Boundary | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Version/edition | Pinned `v0.16.25` digest in Compose; `/api/account` reports `community` |
| Isolation | Two independent config/data volume pairs, one internal network per instance; domains from A absent in B |
| Bootstrap | `x:Bootstrap/get`, `x:Bootstrap/set` through `/jmap`, explicit process restart, domain readback |
| Object encoding | `roles`, `permissions`, encryption settings use `@type`; credentials are keyed list objects, not ordinary JSON arrays |
| Account provisioning | `x:Account/set` creates a test user bound to its local `domainId`; account-level disk quota included |
| Authorization | Other instance's admin credential rejected; A's mailbox credential rejected by B; ordinary mailbox user cannot enumerate managed accounts |
| SMTP/JMAP | TLS submission on 465 accepts A's message; `Email/query` reads it in A, not B |
| Envelope policy | A's authenticated sender cannot submit with B's envelope address |
| Defensive adapter | Five tests cover unsafe endpoint config, redirects, mismatched JMAP responses, per-object errors, timeout without retry, and a streamed oversized response |

Stalwart's local account IDs are not globally unique. In the inspected deployments the domain had ID `b` and the mailbox account ID `c` in both instances. These are observations, not constants the application may depend on.

A Docker idle snapshot of two bootstrapped instances with a test account reported approximately 85.2 MiB each and 0% CPU. No production mail corpus, real spam feeds, attachments, search workload or concurrency was present. Do not use this point observation as a loaded capacity target.

## Still unverified / not implemented

- Public ingress/network integration, production monitoring, restore/load testing and recovery for unknown first-bootstrap outcomes. The private Kubernetes rollout and explicit retries for previously verified instances are implemented and live-tested.
- Public recipient-aware SMTP ingress, instance routing for client protocols, production TLS and relay egress rules.
- TLS relay to Turbo, BYOK credentials, exact downstream event correlation and webhook reconciliation.
- Visible From-header policy; the passing SMTP test covers the envelope only.
- Shared monthly budgets across every path, including JMAP, forwarding and server-generated notifications.
- Better Auth → Stalwart OIDC, revocation, shared mailboxes, native Webmail and attachment safety.
- Forwarding/SRS/DMARC compatibility, production spam/malware handling, restore and load tests.

No claim of those remaining gates passing is implied by the local tests. In particular, a created CE `Tenant` object does not demonstrate Enterprise isolation, and Stalwart queue acceptance does not demonstrate Turbo or final-recipient delivery.

## Managed-agent verification (2026-10-10 continuation)

- Auth tests: **135/135 passed**, including activation, capacity races/retained storage, tenant-preview restrictions, assigned-cluster claim/checkpoint/completion, agent-generation fencing and duplicate completion rejection.
- Hosting agent: **48 tests passed, one opt-in Docker test skipped in the normal suite**. The real Docker test was run separately and passed.
- Real restricted-container test: pinned CE derivative runs as UID/GID 65532, read-only root, no capabilities; bootstrap to permanent credentials; explicit private listeners 8080/2525/2465/1993; health checks before/after bootstrap; normal administrator verified and temporary administrator rejected after restart. Data survives container recreation; TLS SMTP submission answers EHLO on port 2465.
- Auth and Mail TypeScript checks pass. The full Auth suite required the baseline tenant-preview schema in the dedicated disposable local PostgreSQL database; no production DB configuration was copied.
- Credential checkpoint, final instance registration, lifecycle completion and resource accounting are transactionally fenced. New agent registrations cannot continue old leases. Unknown external writes are not replayed.
- `MAIL_MANAGED_CLUSTER_ID` selects the existing platform k3s cluster. Docker worker execution is explicitly restricted to local integration mode.

The live Kubernetes rollout is recorded in [production evidence](../verification/2026-10-10-native-mail-rollout.json).
One explicitly activated Spitzli instance was provisioned; its original PVC survived
suspension and resume. Revision 6 is ready, temporary recovery access is removed,
and the private TLS submission endpoint answers EHLO. Auth and Studio run with
verified Frankfurt Functions, built locally and deployed prebuilt. Vercel packaging,
CDN and control-plane services remain global; this is not a complete EU-only claim.
Public TLS/SMTP ingress, provider relay delivery, backups/restores and a complete
user-facing Webmail flow are not established by these checks.

## Review corrections

An independent review found two concrete agent defects. Both were reproduced
with failing tests and corrected: first storage allocation now works even when
activation intent reached revision 3 before any provisioning, while existing
instances retain the missing-disk protection; unsafe optional Mail configuration
now suppresses only the Mail capability and does not interrupt ordinary hosting.
The shared storage adapter preserves the actual Kubernetes resource revision.

A live resume test exposed a Kubernetes replica ownership conflict. Suspension now
uses the same server-side-apply path as provisioning. The regression was reproduced
and fixed, and a subsequent live suspend/resume completed on the same PVC. A narrowly
fenced one-time correction repaired only the confirmed field ownership on the test
instance; the operator then requeued verification through Studio, not a database
status reset. Tests, lint, Auth/Studio/Mail typechecks and builds pass.

Dependency audit: DOMPurify was patched to 3.4.16. Seventeen transitive advisories
remain (12 high, five moderate), primarily the unpatched braces toolchain and old
Drizzle/esbuild tooling. No unsafe major-version downgrade or audit-clean claim is
made. Existing public Mail and native Webmail implementation gaps remain above.
