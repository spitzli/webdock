# Actions publisher and private registry on the existing application node

Status: **operator runbook, not applied**. The October 10 read-only inspection of
`root@213.136.65.22` (`vmd208517`) found 6 CPUs, 11 GiB RAM (about 10 GiB available),
188 GiB free disk, k3s/containerd, and no registry, skopeo, nginx, Node or Vercel CLI.
This adds no purchased infrastructure. Customer builds remain on GitHub Actions;
this node downloads, validates and publishes artifacts only. Never run `npm ci`,
Dockerfile builds, `vercel build`, customer scripts or guest.py on this node.

## Deployment inputs and prerequisites

Record the actual customer ID, project ID, control URL, storage-location evidence,
GitHub App Actions-read approval and enrolled artifact-only worker credential.
Lunares project is `101713101337919488`; verify the customer ID from trusted control
records. Replace `CUSTOMER_ID` below before installation. The sole repository is:

```
127.0.0.1:5443/customers/CUSTOMER_ID/projects/101713101337919488
```

This address works for **this single node**: kubelet/containerd pulls from host
loopback, not pod loopback. Adding another node requires an explicit registry
migration; never silently schedule these images onto another node.

Use signed Ubuntu packages for `docker-registry`, `nginx`, `skopeo` and
`apache2-utils` (htpasswd). Read-only apt-cache candidates on this node were
`2.8.2+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.3`, `1.24.0-2ubuntu7.18` and
`1.13.3+ds1-2ubuntu0.24.04.3`, respectively. Recheck security updates at execution.
Prevent package-service autostart during installation using the host's approved
package procedure; do not replace an existing policy-rc.d. Default nginx must not
start on port 80, which belongs to the existing ingress. Use only the custom units
below. Install a checksum-verified official Node 24 distribution, not Ubuntu's
Node 18 candidate, and operator-installed Vercel CLI **63.1.2** at
`/usr/local/bin/vercel`. Installing these trusted tools is separate from customer
build execution. Verify `skopeo --version`, `node --version`, `vercel --version`.

Prepare dedicated unprivileged users `webdock-registry`, `webdock-registry-proxy`,
and `webdock-publisher`. A `webdock-registry-socket` group grants only the first two
users access to the backend socket. Create private directories:

```
/etc/webdock-registry/                         root, group webdock-registry-socket, 0750
/var/lib/webdock-registry/                     webdock-registry, 0700
/var/lib/webdock-registry-proxy/               webdock-registry-proxy, 0700
/etc/webdock-artifact-publisher/               root, group webdock-publisher, 0750
/var/lib/webdock-artifact-publisher/artifacts/  webdock-publisher, 0700
```

Budget registry disk separately (initially 20 GiB), alert before exhaustion, and
keep 5 GiB free for import staging. The worker's artifact-store ceiling does **not**
limit registry storage. Do not enable registry deletion/GC until retained release
references and rollback protection are implemented; GC must use a stopped/read-only
registry. Do not delete existing `webdock.local` images.

## TLS and separate repository identities

Generate a private CA and a server certificate with IP SAN `127.0.0.1`, using
OpenSSL on the operator machine or root-only node directory. CA key stays outside
service access. The server private key is root-owned, group
`webdock-registry-proxy`, 0640; install certificate as `server.crt`, key as
`server.key`, CA as `ca.crt` under `/etc/webdock-registry`. No insecure TLS flags.
Example server certificate extensions:

```ini
basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE
keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth
subjectAltName=IP:127.0.0.1
```

Create independent high-entropy `lunares-pull` and `lunares-publish` passwords using
an operator password generator. Generate bcrypt htpasswd entries with `htpasswd
-iB` reading passwords over stdin, never command arguments. Write
`/etc/webdock-registry/users.htpasswd` root:proxy-group 0640. Store publisher auth
in a root-owned 0640 JSON authfile readable by `webdock-publisher`; store pull auth
only in the two Kubernetes pull secrets. Never print either JSON or use CLI
password flags. No GitHub PAT is needed.

Both identities need registry reads (`GET`, `HEAD`) for protocol negotiation and
blob checks. Only publisher may write (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`); neither may delete,
list repositories, access another repository, or mount blobs from another repo.
Basic auth alone in Distribution does not impose these method/repository rules;
the following proxy is the authorization boundary.

## Registry backend: Unix socket only

Install `/etc/webdock-registry/config.yml`, root:webdock-registry-socket 0640:

```yaml
version: 0.1
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/webdock-registry
  delete:
    enabled: false
  redirect:
    disable: true
http:
  net: unix
  addr: /run/webdock-registry/registry.sock
  host: https://127.0.0.1:5443
  relativeurls: true
```

Use `/etc/systemd/system/webdock-private-registry.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Webdock private OCI registry backend
After=local-fs.target
[Service]
User=webdock-registry
Group=webdock-registry-socket
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-registry serve /etc/webdock-registry/config.yml
Restart=on-failure
UMask=0007
RuntimeDirectory=webdock-registry
RuntimeDirectoryMode=0750
NoNewPrivileges=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
PrivateDevices=yes
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=yes
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/webdock-registry /run/webdock-registry
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX
MemoryMax=512M
CPUQuota=100%
TasksMax=64
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Check the package binary path before enabling. Distribution supports Unix sockets;
there is no unauthenticated backend TCP listener to bypass the proxy.

## Loopback TLS proxy with exact repository authorization

Install `/etc/webdock-registry/nginx.conf`; replace `CUSTOMER_ID` in the regex.
The proxy service must be able to read certificate, key and password hashes.

```nginx
worker_processes 1;
pid /run/webdock-registry-proxy/nginx.pid;
error_log stderr warn;
events { worker_connections 128; }
http {
  access_log off;
  client_body_temp_path /var/lib/webdock-registry-proxy/body;
  proxy_temp_path /var/lib/webdock-registry-proxy/proxy;

    ~^lunares-publish:(GET|HEAD|POST|PATCH|PUT):/v2/customers/CUSTOMER_ID/projects/101713101337919488/blobs/uploads/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)?$ 1;

  }
  server {

    client_max_body_size 512m;
    client_body_timeout 180s;
    auth_basic "Webdock private registry";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/webdock-registry/users.htpasswd;
    if ($registry_allowed = 0) { return 403; }
    if ($arg_from != "") { return 403; }
    if ($arg_mount != "") { return 403; }
    # Reject noncanonical path encodings; preserve legitimate upload-state query strings.
    if ($request_uri ~ "^[^?]*(%|//|\\.\\.)") { return 403; }
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://unix:/run/webdock-registry/registry.sock;
      proxy_set_header Host 127.0.0.1:5443;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
      proxy_set_header Authorization "";
      proxy_request_buffering off;
      proxy_buffering off;
      proxy_read_timeout 180s;
      proxy_send_timeout 180s;
    }
  }
}
```

Install `/etc/systemd/system/webdock-registry-proxy.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Webdock loopback TLS registry authorization
After=webdock-private-registry.service
Requires=webdock-private-registry.service
[Service]
User=webdock-registry-proxy
Group=webdock-registry-proxy
SupplementaryGroups=webdock-registry-socket
ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t -c /etc/webdock-registry/nginx.conf
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/webdock-registry/nginx.conf -g "daemon off;"
Restart=on-failure
RuntimeDirectory=webdock-registry-proxy
RuntimeDirectoryMode=0700
UMask=0077
NoNewPrivileges=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
PrivateDevices=yes

RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_INET
MemoryMax=128M

TasksMax=32
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Verify syntax and socket access before enabling; test this exact auth policy with
real skopeo before calling it verified. A write-only publisher in product language
still needs read methods for blob existence checks; the pull identity has no write
methods. No host firewall port opening is required.

## Containerd and skopeo CA trust, without restarting workloads

Live containerd already has
`config_path = "/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/certs.d"`.
Create the registry-specific directory `127.0.0.1:5443` there and install public
CA `ca.crt` plus `hosts.toml` (root-owned, no credentials):

```toml
server = "https://127.0.0.1:5443"
[host."https://127.0.0.1:5443"]
  capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
  ca = "/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/certs.d/127.0.0.1:5443/ca.crt"
```

Containerd reads changes under its existing hosts directory without daemon restart.
Install the same public CA at `/etc/containers/certs.d/127.0.0.1:5443/ca.crt` for
skopeo. Do not install pull credentials globally in containerd or registries.yaml;
Kubernetes supplies project-specific imagePullSecrets.

For persistence across future k3s starts/upgrades, also record the CA-only exact
host entry in `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml`, merging any existing contents:

```yaml
configs:
  "127.0.0.1:5443":
    tls:
      ca_file: /etc/webdock-registry/ca.crt
```

Do not restart k3s now. Its registries.yaml generation applies on a subsequent
restart; the already-configured containerd hosts directory provides current trust.
Verify it remains correct after the next planned upgrade/restart. Do not configure
wildcard mirrors, skip-verification, or global credentials.

## Upgrade only the trusted hosting-agent code

Installed agent release `2026-10-08-live-v1` has no registry.py/registry capability.
Copy the reviewed agent module set into a **new** root-owned version directory,
e.g. `/opt/webdock-hosting-agent-releases/ACTIONS_RELEASE/`, rather than overwriting
the live directory. Include daemon.py, observer.py, executor.py, connect.py, byok.py,
storage_client.py and registry.py from the same reviewed checkout. Compile-check
those modules before changing the service. Compare changes against installed code
and preserve the custom Lunares network helper and the separate storage service.

Preserve `/var/lib/webdock-hosting-agent/connection.json` exactly: never re-enroll,
reset its sequence, print it or replace it with development credentials. Preserve
all existing systemd hardening and `storage.conf` drop-ins. Use a new drop-in:

```ini
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/webdock-hosting-agent-releases/ACTIONS_RELEASE
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/webdock-hosting-agent-releases/ACTIONS_RELEASE/daemon.py --credentials /var/lib/webdock-hosting-agent/connection.json --interval 15
Environment=WEBDOCK_REGISTRY_CONFIG=/etc/webdock-registry/agent-policy.json
```

Prepare root-owned 0600 `agent-policy.json`:

```json
{"version":1,"euStorageEvidence":"ACTUAL_OPERATOR_LOCATION_AND_STORAGE_RECORD","projects":{"101713101337919488":{"repository":"127.0.0.1:5443/customers/CUSTOMER_ID/projects/101713101337919488","pullSecret":"lunares-registry-pull","readOnly":true,"credentialScopeEvidence":"RECORDED_READ_METHOD_AND_REPOSITORY_DENIAL_TESTS"}}}
```

Create `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` secret `lunares-registry-pull` in **both**
`wd-101713101337919488` and `wdv-101713101337919488`, with auth host
`127.0.0.1:5443` and only the pull identity. Use root-private manifests piped to
`k3s kubectl apply -f -`; never pass passwords in command arguments or print
secret data. Registry capability 1 is advertised only when policy and both secret
types exist. It does not independently prove credentials work; real pull tests do.

Restart only `webdock-hosting-agent` after confirming no operation is executing;
observe its next heartbeat. Existing `webdock.local/...` images remain `Never`.
Only the exact allowed registry repository at immutable digest receives
`IfNotPresent` and the project pull secret. Other project/repository requests to
this registry fail closed, including cached images. On failure, restore the prior
ExecStart/WorkingDirectory drop-in and restart the agent, preserving credentials.

## Artifact publisher

Deploy reviewed build-worker modules to a versioned path. Install the supplied
`apps/build-worker/webdock-artifact-publisher.service`, adjusting its ExecStart to
that path. Its limits are 4 GiB RAM, two CPU cores and one serialized work slot.
The registry/proxy budgets add 640 MiB RAM and 1.5 CPUs; verify total headroom before
enabling. Python importer staging uses the service's private /tmp.

Root-owned 0640 publisher configuration, readable only by its service group:

```json
{
  "controlURL":"https://AUTH_HOST/api/hosting/git/worker",
  "credentialFile":"/etc/webdock-artifact-publisher/credential",
  "country":"ACTUAL_TWO_LETTER_COUNTRY",
  "locationEvidence":"ACTUAL_RECORD_OR_EXPLICIT_UNVERIFIED",
  "storageEvidence":"ACTUAL_PRIVATE_STORAGE_RECORD",
  "isolation":"artifact-only",
  "isolationEvidence":"Only validated Actions artifacts; no customer execution",
  "artifactRoot":"/var/lib/webdock-artifact-publisher/artifacts",
  "maxStoreBytes":21474836480,
  "registryProjects":{
    "101713101337919488":{
      "repository":"127.0.0.1:5443/customers/CUSTOMER_ID/projects/101713101337919488",
      "authFile":"/etc/webdock-artifact-publisher/lunares-publish.json"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `ZZ` with explicit “unverified” location evidence if physical location has not
been independently verified; an IP address does not prove location. The hosting
registry policy's `euStorageEvidence` must reference real verified evidence.
Configure control-plane `WEBDOCK_GIT_REGISTRY_HOST=127.0.0.1:5443` through its private
configuration channel. Do not print the rest of that environment. Enroll the
artifact-only role, store the returned credential privately, then enable the
publisher only after all following acceptance checks pass.

## Acceptance order and rollback

1. Confirm only `127.0.0.1:5443` listens; no public registry port or backend TCP.
2. Unauthenticated requests must fail; pull identity GET/HEAD works but every
   POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE fails. Both identities must fail on another repository,
   catalog, encoded path traversal and cross-repository `mount`/`from` requests.
3. Push a validated existing Actions OCI artifact with `skopeo copy
   --preserve-digests --authfile /PRIVATE/PUBLISH_AUTH --digestfile /PRIVATE/DIGEST
   oci-archive:/PRIVATE/image.tar docker://127.0.0.1:5443/customers/CUSTOMER_ID/projects/101713101337919488:release-RELEASE_ID`.
   Compare returned manifest digest to the locally verified manifest. Use the
   authorized release path for production artifacts; do not fabricate release IDs.
4. Prove kubelet pull with the project pull secret in validation namespace before
   changing the application. Test registry credentials via private files/stdin;
   never `crictl --creds username:password` or `curl -u username:password` argv.
5. Verify agent heartbeat reports registryVersion 1 and existing application remains
   ready with its original digest and `Never` policy until a release is approved.
6. Import one successful GitHub Actions artifact, verify provenance, publish through
   existing fenced release flow, observe actual readiness, then verify rollback.
   Ambiguous publication enters reconciliation; do not blindly republish.
7. Disable publisher service to stop new work. Registry outage should not stop the
   existing running container; preserve cached immutable previous images and registry
   data for rollback. Removing a pull secret or registry trust is not a rollback.

This runbook intentionally does not execute any production installation commands.
