# Webdock plugin registry project

The owner requested a project for the registry on 2026-10-16. It was created through the authenticated Console in the **Webdock** workspace, separately from **Webdock Plattform**.

- Workspace: `103216044377636864` (Webdock).
- Project: `104618288083894272` (Webdock Plugin Registry).
- Console: <https://console.webdock.dev/hosting/projects/104618288083894272/overview>.
- Source repository recorded: <https://github.com/TabularisDB/tabularium>.

The registry is deployed at **https://registry.webdock.dev** on Webdock Cluster EU (`102835722657992704`). Tabularium 0.25.0 is initialized with PostgreSQL, a persistent data volume, a generated Ed25519 registry signing key and a verified bootstrap admin login. This is a plugin metadata registry, not an OCI image store. Webdock plugin publication and the signed install round-trip remain separate work.

Use separate deployment configuration and registry credentials for this project. Keep the plugin runtime installer independent of its registry being online: installed verified release bytes and image identities remain in Webdock. The registry kind/schema and signed release round-trip still require the runtime plan's Core Task 5 verification.

## PostgreSQL — provisioned 2026-10-16

The owner selected the existing PostgreSQL server with a separate logical database and user. No extra server or paid database order was created.

- Existing installation: `103217546630533120` on `wd-eu-02`, namespace `wd-db-103217546630533120`.
- Existing Main database remains `db_103217546714419200`.
- Registry database and login: `webdock_plugin_registry`.
- Host: `db-103217546630533120.pg.webdock.dev`; direct port `32000`, existing transaction pooler port `32001`.
- TLS certificate and hostname verification are mandatory; use the existing private CA.
- Credentials/CA are in Kubernetes Secret `webdock-plugin-registry-db` in that database namespace. Private operator copies are under `/home/newt/.cache/webdock-plugin-registry/` with mode-0600 credential files. Do not put passwords in project notes, Git or deployment logs.
- The login owns only the registry database, has no superuser/create-database/create-role/replication/bypass-RLS privileges or role memberships, and is limited to 10 connections. PUBLIC database/schema access is revoked.

Direct and pooled TLS logins, transactional table creation/read/write/rollback, invalid-password rejection and denied Main-database login were verified. Main schema/catalog fingerprint and database ACL are unchanged. PostgreSQL and PgBouncer remained on their original pods with zero container restarts. See `docs/verification/2026-10-16-plugin-registry-database.json`.

The database is an operator-managed auxiliary database, not a separate customer Managed PostgreSQL order; the Console's order list therefore does not show a new purchased database. Its project notes record the association. The registry application uses its own encrypted environment value for the internal PostgreSQL URL with `sslmode=verify-full`. The public database CA is stored at `/data/postgres-ca.crt` and loaded with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Tabularium migrations ran through its authenticated installation API.

## Preserve during agent maintenance

The root-owned `/etc/webdock-postgres.json` has this additive configuration:

```json
{"platformAuxiliaryDatabases":{"103217546714419200":[{"name":"webdock_plugin_registry","roles":["webdock_plugin_registry"],"projectID":"104618288083894272"}]}}
```

The agent generates an exact TLS-only HBA rule and project-specific ingress for this database, retains the Main rule, and refuses ordinary parent maintenance/purge/migration while auxiliary databases require reviewed offline maintenance. Removing configuration is not a data deletion or migration workflow. Registry and Main share the instance's capacity and maintenance lifecycle.

Only the auxiliary support was overlaid onto the deployed `console-setup-a0a0876/databases.py`; unrelated live code was preserved. The agent was restarted after confirming no live cluster operations. Original module/config backups are under `/root/webdock-plugin-registry-20261016` on node02. Preserve this addition on later agent rollouts; the repository contains the matching implementation and tests. The existing live `webdock_registry_runtime` HBA permission was also retained in the configuration rather than being lost on reconciliation.

PostgreSQL role/database commands follow the [PostgreSQL 18 role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createrole.html) and [database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createdatabase.html) contracts. The database verification file records the earlier database-only checkpoint. The subsequent application rollout is recorded in `docs/verification/2026-10-16-plugin-registry-runtime.json`.

## Application — deployed 2026-10-16

- Application: `104651089088876544`; setup: `104648662839201792`.
- Console: <https://console.webdock.dev/hosting/apps/104651089088876544>.
- Namespace: `wd-104618288083894272`; Deployment/Service: `app-104651089088876544`.
- Image: `ghcr.io/tabularisdb/tabularium@sha256:3384ebd98e74f704b31653d921ad872f94936e29ad3fef6c0281519ad9304cf3`, version 0.25.0, source revision `5d1818352f7e4a018f6ace31a7f185d5a6b6f292`.
- One replica, 1000m CPU, 512 MiB RAM, 256 MiB ephemeral storage, 1 GiB retained `/data` volume. Runs as UID 65532 with read-only root.
- Operator custom plan `Webdock intern – Registry` supplies this allocation; no additional paid service order was placed. Existing database billing remains separate.
- Normal readiness/liveness path: `/healthz`. Initial provisioning used `/api/init/status` until database initialization completed.
- DNS: Vercel team `spitzli`, `registry.webdock.dev A 79.143.177.157`, record `rec_6e6404f3bc8cb9b007c4e1ea`.
- Namespace-scoped Let's Encrypt issuer `webdock-acme`, certificate/Secret `registry-tls`. HTTP redirects to HTTPS; ACME uses its own longer challenge path.
- Operator networking/certificate manifests: `infra/registry/runtime-infrastructure.json`. Preserve these separately managed objects during hosting-agent maintenance. They allow only the registry app to reach the existing PostgreSQL pods on 5432; the database ingress/HBA separately allows the registry project and login.
- JWT, token-encryption and bootstrap secrets are encrypted in Webdock application configuration. Preserve them and `/data/config.json` during redeploys. Do not reinitialize a populated database or rotate keys without a migration plan.
- Initial admin: `admin@example.com`; sign in at <https://registry.webdock.dev/login/admin>, then open `/admin`. The password is in the operator-only local file `/home/newt/.cache/webdock-plugin-registry/registry-admin-access.txt` (0600); it is not committed. The normal login was verified after installation and restart. Tabularium disables this recovery login when the admin links an OAuth identity.
- Signing-key ID: `5d8025c66487bb44`; public endpoint `/.well-known/registry-key.json`. This key has not yet been enrolled in the Webdock plugin trust configuration.

The application is an initialized, empty Tabularium registry. GitHub OAuth and the Webdock-specific plugin kind/schema are configured. Publishing and installation verification remain outstanding; a successful registry deployment does not establish those capabilities.

## Requested follow-up

After the registry, deploy Plausible at `moon.webdock.dev` for the Webdock start page. Then offer managed tracking as a mini addon with an optional custom tracking domain. Owner requested this sequence on 2026-10-16; Plausible has not been provisioned by this registry rollout.

## GitHub OAuth — 2026-10-16

The existing **Webdock Studio** GitHub App owned by **spitzli** is reused (App ID `5176593`, Client ID `Iv23liif2SH8rJxcNWRs`). Added the exact callback `https://registry.webdock.dev/auth/github/callback`; retained both Studio callbacks, the existing webhook and all permissions. No new app or secret rotation.

Registry provider `github` is enabled with the existing OAuth client credentials, encrypted by Tabularium. Credentials are shared with the existing Webdock integration; future rotation must update both consumers. GitHub authorization displays **Webdock Studio**.

`infra/registry/github-egress.json` permits this registry app to reach GitHub's published IPv4 `web` and `api` ranges on TCP 443. The ranges were fetched from `https://api.github.com/meta`; refresh them when GitHub changes its published ranges. In-pod HTTPS checks to github.com and api.github.com returned 200. Other external destinations remain denied.

End-to-end verified: the GitHub callback linked `NewtTheWolf` to the existing admin user `01M530P3DTPXCQDFKY9HFWF4RT`. `/auth/me` reports role `admin` and the GitHub identity; provider `lastUsedAt` is populated. Tabularium reports `emailRecoveryAvailable: false`, so the initial email/password login is now disabled. Use **Sign in → GitHub** at the registry.

## Webdock registry configuration — 2026-10-16

- Kind `extension` with the complete generated runtime field schema from `tools/plugins/tabularium-kind.schema.json`. No unrelated driver/theme kinds were added.
- Required kind, operator approval, JSON manifest paths `.tabularium` and `tabularium.json`. Registry authoring validation has its own 64 KiB request cap; the SDK host contract is 256 KiB.
- Webdock name, orange palette, existing light/dark wordmarks and favicon, English/German home copy and About page. The companion-app promotion is disabled because its stock copy falsely promises one-click runtime installation.
- **External docs URL remains `https://docs.webdock.dev/`**, as explicitly selected by the owner. Header and footer links verified in the browser. Plugin pages and navigation are added under `docs/developers/`; they are not yet published by the connected `main`-branch Mintlify deployment.
- Public configuration snapshot: `infra/registry/webdock-configuration.json`; kind schema is referenced rather than duplicated. OAuth secrets and runtime secrets are excluded. Apply through authenticated admin APIs/MCP, preserving unrelated settings.
- Registry MCP `webdock-registry` is authenticated with all 40 available scopes under the existing admin account; the unrelated `tabularium` connection still targets registry.tabularis.dev.

### Runtime validation finding

Bun 1.3.14 JIT schema compilation failed in the restricted cluster container (`embedder failed to suspend thread`, exit 133 in an isolated compiler probe), while the same pinned image/schema compiled locally. `JSC_useJIT=false` made the isolated cluster probe complete. The native application environment now retains that setting; the internal allowance and app CPU were raised from 500m to 1000m. App revision 4 is healthy with zero restarts after the final sequential checks.

The complete schema is retained without loosening validation or container security. Each validation currently recompiles AJV synchronously and took roughly 3.5–5 seconds in live checks. Back-to-back validation requests can temporarily fail readiness and return 503; the verification cases are deliberately paced by three seconds. This is a remaining Tabularium performance limitation, not evidence of load readiness. A bounded compiled-validator cache in upstream Tabularium is the appropriate follow-up.

The actual validator retained the valid fixture byte-for-byte as a JSON value and rejected missing runtime fields, mutable image tags, unknown privileged fields, missing kind and unsupported protocol. See `docs/verification/2026-10-16-plugin-registry-manifests.json`. This is schema round-trip evidence only; no forge release, signed artifact ingestion or host installation was performed.

The unused kind was renamed from `webdock-plugin` to `extension` at the owner’s request. The catalog was empty (0 plugins). Labels are **Extensions / Erweiterungen**. SDK, fixtures, public docs and registry configuration now require `extension`; the runtime field semantics are unchanged.

The owner subsequently requested the Tabularis registry convention: kind-specific runtime fields now live directly at the manifest root. The `x-webdock` wrapper was removed from the SDK, fixture, generated registry schema and live kind. Tabularis driver/theme schemas were inspected read-only; the other registry was not modified. No published plugins required migration.

## First public developer alpha — 2026-10-17

Project Notes `0.1.0-alpha.2` is published and approved as a **prerelease**, without a verified badge. Source and GHCR container are public; production Console installation is still unavailable. The descriptor matches the tagged manifest bytes and its JWS was verified against the previously established Ed25519 key. Two real English screenshots are included and displayed by the registry.

GitHub asset egress is narrowly allowed by `infra/registry/github-assets-egress.json` for the currently resolved raw/release/object asset addresses on 443. Refresh these addresses if GitHub changes them. The GitHub release webhook was installed with the existing registry secret using the operator account because the shared GitHub App returned 403 for hook creation. No webhook secret was rotated or committed.

Release uploads must include both `tabularium.json` (strict manifest ingestion) and `<id>-universal.json` (platform descriptor), with identical bytes. A burst of release events hit the known validation/readiness limitation and one callback returned 503; targeted GitHub redelivery and the registry asset recheck completed ingestion. Final signature verification passed. GitHub ping events are rejected with 400 by this release-only endpoint; actual release deliveries returned 200.
