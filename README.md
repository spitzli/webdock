# Webdock

Webdock is a plugin-based admin platform with a small identity, project registry and capability core. Hosting, databases, Mail and storage are optional product modules; new installations enable no products by default. Billing is not included. It is maintained by Spitzli Development. Customer websites keep their own repositories and content stores.

## Self-hosting

Start with the [selfhosting guide](https://docs.webdock.dev/developers/self-hosting/) and the verified developer-alpha artifacts under [Releases](https://github.com/spitzli/webdock/releases). Linux AMD64 is the tested architecture. You provide a dedicated PostgreSQL 18 database, verified database TLS, HTTPS ingress and private credentials.

| Installation | Images | Products |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | `api-core`, `console-core`, `auth` | None enabled; product-free API and Console runtime |
| Full | `api`, `console`, `auth`, optional `worker` | Explicitly configured Mail, Hosting, Databases and Storage |

Both use `migrate` only for offline database setup/upgrades. The migration baseline retains historical product schemas; the small Core runtime does not delete old data. Initialize empty plugin state, create the first operator, then complete password replacement and real MFA before using Console. Local Better Auth is the default; Clerk is optional. External runtime plugins need separate installation and explicit project grants.

The alpha includes signed checksums, an image manifest and native execution evidence. Read the guide's verification and operational limits before exposing an installation. A ready container is not proof of your SMTP delivery or reverse-proxy configuration.

## License

Original Webdock code is **AGPL-3.0-only**. Separate written commercial or special licenses may be available from Spitzli Development for code it owns or may sublicense. See [LICENSE](LICENSE), [alternative licensing](COMMERCIAL-LICENSING.md) and [contribution requirements](CONTRIBUTING.md). Third-party components keep their own licenses.

## Repository structure

```text
apps/          Executable HTTP applications: Console, Control Plane, Auth, website
modules/       Product behavior: hosting, databases, mail, storage
adapters/      Product area / provider: hosting/vercel, auth/clerk, mail/turbosmtp, …
packages/      Shared contracts, identity, registry, database schema and UI primitives
integrations/  Cross-runtime integrations, including the native Tabularis gateway contract
agents/        Separately privileged executors, currently Kubernetes
deploy/       Container, Compose and Helm distribution
tools/        Installation, migration, release and test tooling
docs/         Public guides and internal architecture/verification records
```

The module owns what an operation means; the adapter implements its provider-specific I/O. The Control Plane composes them and supplies server-side credentials. The Console calls the API and never receives provider credentials. Modules are selected per installation and retain tenant/project authorization within that installation. See [adapter layout](adapters/README.md), [module configuration](docs/developers/modules.mdx), [self-hosting](docs/developers/self-hosting.mdx) and [implementation status](docs/architecture/modular-platform-status.md).

## Runtime responsibilities

| Runtime | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/console` (`@webdock/admin`) | Operator and customer browser interface |
| `apps/control-plane` (`@webdock/api`) | Authentication composition, authorization, core registry, product services, protocols and optional workers |
| `apps/auth` (`@webdock/auth`) | Native account setup and retained authentication frontend |
| `apps/website` (`@webdock/web`) | Public website and its own CMS |
| `apps/database-gateway` | Scoped access to isolated native Tabularis runtimes |
| `agents/kubernetes` | Enrolled execution and reconciliation on authorized clusters |
| `apps/cms` (`@webdock/cms`) | Archived shared-CMS notice and offline migration tools; excluded from npm workspaces/build |

Browser authentication can use Clerk or Better Auth. Better Auth uses local roles and memberships; selecting Clerk makes freshly verified Clerk operator roles and organization permissions authoritative. Local immutable IDs and explicit mappings remain, and local bans can deny access but cannot grant Clerk privileges. Identities are never automatically linked by email. Legacy OAuth, MCP and service credentials keep their own contracts. See [authentication adapters](docs/developers/auth-adapters.mdx).

Product selection is installation-wide. `enabled` allows authorized operations, `draining` blocks new provisioning while retaining supported management/reconciliation, and `disabled` removes product access after retained-resource checks. Core registry and platform persistence do not depend on customer CMS or Databases being enabled. Enabling a module does not create provider accounts, subscriptions or customer infrastructure.

## Development

Use Node 24, the workspace-pinned Bun runtime and the root npm lockfile:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev                 # public website
npm run dev:admin           # Console, port 3120
npm run dev:auth            # native Auth frontend
npm run dev -w @webdock/api # Control Plane
npm run test:modules
npm run test:unit -w @webdock/api
npm run test -w @webdock/admin
```

Prepare each app's local configuration before starting it. Consult its environment examples and [local development](docs/developers/local-development.mdx). Never commit production credentials or use customer databases for tests. Runtime configuration supplies origins and module selection; provider secrets remain server-side.

## Tests and installation

API integration and restricted-role tests use owned disposable local PostgreSQL fixtures:

```sh
npm run test:setup -w @webdock/api
npm run test:integration -w @webdock/api
npm run test:ported -w @webdock/api
npm run test:setup:rls -w @webdock/api
npm run test:rls -w @webdock/api
npm run test:teardown -w @webdock/api
```

Follow [self-hosting](docs/developers/self-hosting.mdx) and [initial operator setup](docs/developers/initial-setup.mdx) for the explicit offline migration and bootstrap flow. Container, Compose and Helm artifacts are under `deploy/`; release validation is under `tools/release/`. Runtime roles are restricted, migration credentials are separate, and schema changes never run implicitly from browser requests. A local successful build is not a production deployment or published release.

## Identifiers

Platform-owned IDs use **Snowflake**, selected on 2026-10-03: a 2026-01-01 epoch, 41 timestamp bits, node 0 in 10 bits and a 12-bit sequence. PostgreSQL coordinates allocation across serverless instances; IDs remain decimal strings in JavaScript, JSON and Payload fields. Failed business transactions do not reuse allocated IDs. Do not allocate node 0 from another independent database for the same ID namespace. Framework/provider-issued IDs remain provider references.

## Architecture and operations

- [Current modular-platform status](docs/architecture/modular-platform-status.md)
- [Module lifecycle and boundaries](docs/architecture/module-installation.md)
- [Provider adapter layout](adapters/README.md)
- [Verification and operational limits](docs/verification/2026-10-15-platform-completion.md)
- [Native Mail deployment decision](docs/architecture/mail-deployment-decision.md)
- [Auth rollout status](docs/architecture/auth-rollout-status.md)
- [Studio MCP, GitHub and passkeys](docs/architecture/studio-integrations.md)

Incoming Mail remains explicitly activated per customer and uses an isolated Stalwart Community Edition instance. Outgoing-only Mail does not allocate Stalwart. Suspension retains data; deletion is a separate authorized operation. Existing Studio/OAuth/MCP protocol URLs and local decimal IDs are compatibility contracts, independent of filesystem names.

The product-free Core API and Console have separate build targets: `npm run build:core`, `npm run build:core:console`, and Docker targets `api-core` / `console-core`. See [Core distribution](docs/developers/core-distribution.mdx). Existing full installations retain the full entry until active product resources are resolved.
