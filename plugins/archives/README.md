# Protected archives

Native, opt-in exports using existing Core resources, durable immediate jobs and
opaque authenticated binary downloads. No second user, queue or permission ledger.

Supported producers:

- **Committed source:** normalized immutable files through the existing repository
  provider/lease protocol, with a true archives job/attempt authority. Includes no
  Git history or runtime volumes; submodule contents and LFS hydration are not
  performed or guaranteed.
- **Observed project report:** gzip CSV from scoped Core project/resource/build
  reads. Only IDs, reviewed enum/slug categories, counts and observation time enter
  cells. User-editable names, URLs, credentials and logs are excluded.
- **Managed PostgreSQL:** a real confirmed dedicated database selected by its Core
  ID. Original actor must retain `org:databases:manage`. Source binds database/backend
  UID, confirmed revisions, host/CA and tenant/project; private derived readonly
  material exists only in memory/RPC/env. Actual TLS/role preflight and app-only
  PG18 custom gzip dump; no shared-table tenant or whole runtime backup claim.
- **Stored completed build log:** actual Core `git_build.logs` from succeeded or failed
  completed builds, selected by Core build ID. Current `org:deployments:create`, tenant,
  hosting mode/native operator and source identity are rechecked. Up to 24,000 stored
  UTF-8 bytes, at most 64 KiB gzip. Potentially sensitive and possibly truncated;
  the existing pipeline masks known environment literal values only. No complete
  stdout, complete secret removal or historical redaction-version claim is made.
- **Submitted diagnostics:** a strict finite allowlist of finished decimal build IDs,
  bounded counters and enums. Unknown/free text, tokens, credentials, URLs and mail
  bodies are rejected. Submitted data does not attest observed service health.

Other output has a 32 MiB limit; build logs use the stricter limits above. Access lifetime 1–86400 seconds, two concurrent producers.
Jobs honor the remaining Core lease, capped at 35 seconds with a safety margin;
pg_dump is capped at 25 seconds. Large bytes use private source streaming, anonymous
staging, verified shared S3 transport and Core's binary gateway, never action JSON.

Actions (same manifest REST/MCP parity): `archives.sources`, `archives.create`,
`archives.generate`, `archives.status`, `archives.download`, `archives.delete`.
Create keeps its `request_id` and Core admission idempotency key on retry. Source-bound
create input adds `source_id` from `archives.sources`; a report selects the current
real project ID. Generate queues the actual Core job. Status reports producer state,
receipt/provenance and the current Core job state. Download requires **both** the
canonical completed job and live original transfer/source authority. Delete revokes
producer epoch before exact-key removal/absence acknowledgment, with explicit retry
if provider deletion is uncertain. Expiry blocks access and is distinct from deletion.

Production-only packaging closure (excludes Core/test dependencies):

```bash
docker build -f plugins/archives/Dockerfile -t <owned-review-tag> .
```

Pinned Rust 1.94.0, PostgreSQL 18.6 and protobuf compiler; nonroot UID 65532. The normal
build rejects fixture configuration and requires verified HTTPS, private policy/ACL,
no versioning and bounded object/multipart lifecycle. Native qualification uses only
`fixtures/Dockerfile.native` with the compile-time run-scoped HTTPS/CA profile; its
explicit MinIO ACL/multipart capability exceptions are absent from production default.
No image is signed, registered or activated merely by building it.

See `docs/operations/protected-archives.md` for operator configuration and exact limits,
and `docs/verification/2026-10-25-completed-buildlogs-r4.md` for current buildlog/native evidence
(r2/r3 retain the earlier product and review-fix qualifications).
Nonempty legacy `databaseSources` configuration is rejected, including in fixture-feature
executables. Every PostgreSQL export requires a live managed Core `source_id` and current
`org:databases:manage`. Historical unqualified rows remain visible for authorized exact
deletion/recovery, but cannot generate output, issue plans or authorize an existing ticket.
Diagnostics remain explicitly submitted, source-free structured snapshots.
