# Managed CMS

An optional Webdock plugin with a native content editor and independent CMS instances. Its control runtime is separate from each project's content database and media volume. The retired shared `apps/cms` is not used.

The plugin uses generic approved application provisioning and scoped HTTP services. Hosting chooses the reviewed image, database plan and resource limits; plugin input cannot choose commands, provider credentials or infrastructure.

## Build and test

From the Webdock repository root, with Node 24 and Bun:

```bash
npm ci
bun test extensions/managed-cms/tests
bun extensions/managed-cms/build.ts
docker build -f extensions/managed-cms/Dockerfile -t managed-cms-plugin .
docker build -f apps/cms-instance/Dockerfile -t managed-cms-instance .
```

The optional signed release build generates `managed-cms.plugin.json` from the exact tested registry root digest (`oci.registryDigest`) and includes it in the signed checksums. For a separate reviewed image, generate its manifest using its actual immutable registry root digest:

```bash
bun extensions/managed-cms/manifest.ts \
  ghcr.io/spitzli/webdock/managed-cms@sha256:ACTUAL_DIGEST \
  managed-cms.plugin.json
```

The runtime listens privately with TLS on port 3443, and serves its sandboxed UI on port 3444. It uses the existing runtime token, host public key, generation, host URL, Console origin and TLS-file environment contract. No CMS credentials are embedded in the UI.

## Installation prerequisites

Use a Full installation with Hosting and Databases, migration 0048 or later, the updated managed agent, an approved CMS image/database plan, cert-manager HTTPS publication for each exact instance hostname and sufficient project capacity. Core-only installations return `capability_unavailable` for provisioning.

Before serving a new CMS image, run its bounded migration job, including `20261018_201453_managed_media_trash`. This additive migration retains existing tables and files.

Configure `WEBDOCK_APPROVED_CMS_TEMPLATE` identically on API and worker, and the matching root-owned agent approval. See [operator configuration](../../agents/kubernetes/APP_TEMPLATES.md) for its exact shape, certificate renewal, migration recovery and matched backups. Install and grant the plugin using Webdock's normal reviewed plugin lifecycle. Each instance owns its cert-manager Certificate, Ingress and TLS Secret; certificate private keys are not copied from a wildcard Secret. Wildcard DNS still routes its hostname to the approved ingress. Installation alone does not create a customer instance; **Create CMS** does.

## Content and access

- English/German pages, structured text/image sections, SEO, media and site settings.
- Readers view content; editors create, edit and publish; administrators delete and restore versions.
- Current website grants are checked on each bridge call. Local user restrictions further limit central roles.
- Documents use optimistic concurrency. An uncertain mutation is surfaced for reconciliation and is never retried automatically.
- Raster media is limited to 10 MiB and 40 megapixels. SVG, HTML and animated images are rejected.
- Existing media files are immutable; upload and select a new item to replace one. Metadata remains editable.
- Managed media removal uses native trash (`removeToTrash`): administrators hide the item from normal lists and fresh public requests while retaining its bytes. Trashed files count toward storage and backups until explicit operator purge; removal does not reclaim quota.
- Disabling the plugin revokes editing and new provisioning while published content continues to serve. Explicit app suspension stops serving and retains data. Deletion/purge is separate.

Existing website integrations keep their schema and use a PostgreSQL transfer journal across serverless requests. Run the website's `cms:migrate` before enabling the bridge and give the runtime DML access to its transfer tables. The single-instance filesystem journal is reserved for independent managed instances.

## Verification boundary

Payload is pinned to `4.0.0-canary.37`. This is a canary dependency, not a stable Payload release. Production readiness requires the complete fresh-instance, role, publication, restart and matched backup/restore acceptance, not just compilation or unit tests. Deployment evidence belongs in the release record. Local image checks do not establish cluster provisioning, certificate issuance or a successful matched backup restore.
